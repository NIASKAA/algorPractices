* What are some advantages/disadvantages to testing your code? -gurantees that when you do push your code up it will be working with the possible cases provided, so more of an extra safety measure, getting rid of bugs before it goes into production-

* What tools would you use to test your code's functionality? -I would use Jest as that is the only one I've used in the past. I am open to others though-

* What is the difference between a unit test and a functional/integration test? -So unit testing is when you take each part of the code in the page and it breaks it down. It will test each part to ensure there are no bugs. Functional testing is more like when you take the code and test whether the code does the job you ask it to do-

* What is the purpose of a code style linting tool? -It checks for programmatic or stylistic errors, it also will improve the quality of the code-

* What are some of the testing best practices? -Being able to tell the test result was a success or fail is important, I heard that automation testing is a  big thing so it would also be wise to include that functionality, also the most important one is that the test is stable-
